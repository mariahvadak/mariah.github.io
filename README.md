#Welcome to My Personal Website!

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for stopping by and checking out my website: https://mariahvadak.github.io/web-portfolio/, feel free to take off your shoes and stay awhile:)

👩‍💻 Who Am I?
I'm just a regular human (well, mostly) who's a computer science major with a passion for traveling, baking, sketching, knitting, and all things artsy. This is my space to share a bit about myself, showcase some past projects, and hopefully learn something along the way.

🎨 What's This Website About?
This website is like a digital scrapbook of my past projects, and a little about me. I wanted a space to try out new web designs and show off what I can do. Here, you'll find:

🌟 Projects: Past projects I have done for others, class, or just things I've explored on my own. If it seems a  little empty, just give me some time. I'm always starting new things, and I can't wait to update my page!

About Me: Before I am a programmer or student, I am a person. If you want to know what I get up to outside of programming, you'll find it here!

💌 Get in Touch
If you want to chat about something on my website, have a question about my resume, or just want to say hi, don't hesitate to reach out. You can find me on LinkedIn or drop me an email at mariahvadak@gmail.com.

🚀 How Did I Build This?
If interested, this website was crafted with love using HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript. It's simple, but I'm all about learning and growing, so expect to see this place evolve.

Final Words
Thanks for taking the time to explore my page! Hope you have an amazing rest of your day:)
